## Tech Stack

The AIT Mess Querying Telegram Bot is built using the following technologies and libraries:

- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code maintainability and scalability.
- Telegraf: A modern and powerful Telegram Bot API framework for Node.js.
- Telegram API: Version 2.0 of the Telegram Bot API, used for seamless communication between the bot and users.
- Lite Inverted Index Map: A custom lightweight version of an inverted index map, inspired by Elasticsearch, for efficient intent detection.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that enables server-side execution of JavaScript code.
- npm: A package manager for installing and managing project dependencies.

## Backend Communication

The College Mess Querying Telegram Bot utilizes the long polling method for backend communication. In this approach, the main server will be Telegram's own server, which maintains a long queue to process messages by default. The bot's own server is responsible for handling incoming requests and processing them accordingly. This setup ensures efficient and reliable communication between the bot and Telegram users.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

To streamline the development process, this project has leveraged GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). A GitHub Actions workflow has been set up to automatically build and deploy the bot from any push to the main branch. This allows for smooth and automated deployment to a Virtual Private Server (VPS) or other hosting environment.
